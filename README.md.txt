Hi there, hope you're good!

This is a small project where I learn to extract and manipulate database data using SQL.

I'm using a database from AOTY of the Top 5000 albums. I then connect to SQLite before creating a table and querying the Top 10 rated albums by unique genre + exporting to Excel file.
